# RWKClient

A desktop client for Robot Wants Kitty, adding support for file & save manipulation, practice mode, and a [mrmasterplan's 3rd party editor](https://github.com/mrmasterplan/rwklevelfiles) integration.

## Getting Started
For normal users, you can download the latest release from the [releases](https://github.com/DogLoverPink/RWKClient/releases) tab.
For explanations on how to use certains features, checkout [features.md](https://github.com/DogLoverPink/RWKClient/blob/main/docs/features.md).

## Compiling from source
If you'd rather not trust a random executable, or if you want contribute to the project, you can compile the project from the source.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or newer recommended)


### 1. Clone or Download the Repository

If using Git:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/DogLoverPink/RWKClient.git
```
Or download and extract the ZIP, then open the folder in your IDE.

#### 2. Install Dependencies

Open a terminal in the project folder and run:
```sh
npm install
```

#### 3. Run the App

```sh
npx electron mod.js
```

## Acknowledgement
I want to extend a huge thank you to [mrmasterplan](https://github.com/mrmasterplan) for making this editor possible. This editor relies heavily on scripts from mrmasterplan's [rwklevelfiles](https://github.com/mrmasterplan/rwklevelfiles), and I encourage you all to check it out if you haven't already.
